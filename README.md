# Hangman-Game

Hangman game written in Python5. This game is the traditional hangman game:
- Guess one letter at a time 
- Correct guesses are added to the word creation
- If a letter appears more than once, it requires more than one guess
- If a letter is capitalized, type it in capital letters
- A wrong guess will construct a piece of the hanging man
- The code will loop until the player either completes the word, or loses the game
in which a 'win' or 'lose' message will appear and the loop will break
